### Pure CSS


<div id="animated_div">CSS</div>

Yes! CSS allows you to animate HTML elements without relying on JavaScript or Flash. Animations let elements transition gradually from one style to another, and you can modify as many CSS properties as you want, as many times as you need.

<Quote text="A line is a dot that went for a walk.
Drawing is taking a line for a walk."  author="Paul Klee"/>



The Pts library embodies this philosophy. Starting with a simple point, it builds concepts when positioned in space and transforms into meaning when shaped into forms. Space and form, in turn, create a context for the point. By treating code as a new medium, Pts automates processes, models abstractions, and designs interactions. Together, Point, Space, and Form orchestrated through Code produce stunning visualizations on a canvas.
