### Pure CSS

It's still the most performat and cross-platform/browser compatible way to animate website elements.
The result is scalable, quick-loading, and well, impressive to see.
Check out some [more examples](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/pure-css-animation-inspiration-on-codepen--cms-30875) of neat pure CSS animations.

### Three

At over 63K stars, this popular library is a great way to create 3D animations on the browser, using WebGL in an intuitive way.
First introduced at April 2010, the library is still being actively developed by nearly 1,000 contributors.

### Pt

"A line is a dot that went for a walk. <br/>
Drawing is taking a line for a walk."  <br/>
Paul Klee

This is what this whole experimental animation library all about. 
It starts with a simple point that creates a concept when put into space and transforms into interpretation when gets into a form. 
The space and the form in return create a context for a point. The code is being viewed as  new medium: 
it can automate processes, model abstractions, and design interactions. All together Point, Space and Form orchestrated by Code created beautiful pictures on a canvas.
