title: Delay. Deny. Defend—Until We Agree.

  rebuild trust and care when people need it most.

**Delay. Deny. Defend.**\
That’s not a conspiracy theory. It’s a documented insurance strategy.

The phrase was popularized by **Jay Feinman**, who described how insurers maximize profit not by care, but by friction:\
delay payments, deny claims, and defend every challenge until people give up.

And it works.\
It’s *incredibly* rewarding financially.

Why?\
Because most people are exhausted, overwhelmed, sick, grieving, or—like many parents—just trying to get through a crisis. Every extra form, requirement change, reprocessing window, or “out of network” surprise shifts cost and burden from insurers to individuals and providers.



**This is not theoretical for me. It’s personal.**

My child is currently in crisis.\
Last week, one of the most critical providers on her care team shared that **nearly all of her claims—across multiple insurers—were suddenly denied**.

Why?\
Because requirements changed. Again.

The target is always moving.

For recurring services, I discovered the provider was suddenly processed as *out of network*. When I reached out to fix the discrepancy, I was told:

* It will take **30 days** to reprocess
* I should **pay out of pocket** and wait for reimbursement
* Or ask the provider to **wait another 30 days** to get paid

I pay my premiums. On time. Every month.\
Yet the experience is confusing, stressful, and adversarial.

And here’s the part that hurts the most:\
**Nothing about this system is designed to improve care.**

- - -

**AI is already being used in insurance. Just not for us.**

Today, AI helps insurers:

* Optimize denials
* Predict which claims are least likely to be appealed
* Automate prior authorizations that quietly fail
* Scale “Delay. Deny. Defend.” at machine speed

That’s AI *against* people.

But it doesn’t have to be this way.

- - -

**There *are* alternatives.**

One example is **Lemonade Insurance**, which rethought incentives from the ground up:

* Flat-fee models instead of denial-driven profit
* Faster, transparent claims
* Alignment between company success and customer outcomes

It’s not perfect—but it proves something important:

> **Insurance doesn’t have to be extractive to be sustainable.**\
> **AI can be used to add value, not just reduce payouts.**

- - -

**So the real question isn’t “Why is insurance so broken?”**\
It’s:

> Why do we still accept a model that profits from delay, denial, and exhaustion—\
> when we have the technology to do better?

AI could be used to:

* Reduce administrative burden for providers
* Detect care gaps early
* Simplify coverage rules instead of weaponizing them
* Support patients and families *when they are most vulnerable*

That’s not radical.\
That’s humane.\
That’s what insurance was supposed to be.

And until we demand systems that serve people—not just balance sheets—\
**Delay. Deny. Defend will keep winning.**





I refuse to accept that this is “just how insurance works.”

In the ways available to me, I’m actively trying to **combat this system**—and that’s exactly why I chose my capstone project: **ClaimGo**.

The goal is simple, but ambitious:\
**Outsmart the moving target that insurers deliberately create—and stay ahead of it.**

Insurers change requirements constantly, not because care improves, but because *friction is profitable*. Every rule change resets the game. Providers scramble. Patients suffer. Families pay upfront. Many give up.

So what if we stopped playing defense?

- - -

### From hidden friction → public accountability

One of the most powerful levers we don’t use today is **transparency**—and the absence of it overwhelmingly benefits insurers, not patients or providers.

ClaimGo explores a future where we **measure and expose friction**, not hide it.

Imagine:

* A **Claim Friction Index** that reflects how hard it actually is to get paid
* A **Denial Risk Score** that predicts the likelihood a valid claim will be rejected
* Scores based on *real behavior*, not marketing promises

Not to shame—but to **create accountability**.

Because once friction is visible, incentives change.

- - -

### Employers as a force for good

Now imagine employers being able to say:

> “We partner with insurers that have the *lowest Claim Friction Index*\
> and the *lowest Denial Risk Score*—because our people matter.”

That becomes a benefit.\
A recruiting advantage.\
A signal of **social capital**.

“Best place for humans to work” wouldn’t just mean snacks and wellness apps—it would mean **your care won’t be trapped in administrative purgatory when you need it most**.

- - -

### This is where AI must stand

Today, AI is often used **against** people:

* To automate denials
* To optimize claim attrition
* To scale Delay. Deny. Defend

But AI could do the opposite.

AI could:

* Anticipate requirement changes before they hurt providers
* Flag denial patterns early
* Reduce administrative burden instead of amplifying it
* Help families, providers, and employers make informed decisions

This is AI **working with humans—not against them**.

- - -

### This is personal. And it’s intentional.

I’m building ClaimGo not as an abstract exercise, but as a response to lived experience—\
as a parent, a technologist, and someone who refuses to normalize harm disguised as process.

We don’t need more complexity.\
We don’t need more “policy updates.”

We need systems that reward **care, clarity, and fairness**.

And with modern technology—including AI—we finally have the tools to build them.

Now we just need the courage to aim them in the right direction.





As I’m working on my capstone idea, I’m choosing a logo that represents this mission—and I want your perspective.

Which one feels like it stands *with patients and providers*?\
Which one feels like it challenges the status quo instead of blending into it?
