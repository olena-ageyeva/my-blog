title: 🚫 Delete ‘Junior’ From Your Title and Your Mind
description: Don’t overestimate the world and underestimate yourself. You are
  better than you think.

**🚫 Don’t sell yourself short — and please stop calling yourself a “junior developer.”**  

Seriously. Putting *"junior developer"* in your resume, LinkedIn headline, or email signature is basically shouting:  
> *“Hi, I’m new, nervous, and unsure if I can do the job—but please hire me anyway and assign a full-time babysitter from your senior dev team for the next six months!”*

But wait — *“I AM a junior developer!”* you say.  
Okay, but here’s the truth bomb 💣: if you want to grow faster and land better roles, **ditch the junior mindset and focus on becoming an intermediate dev**. Build real skills, work on real projects, learn how things work (yes, including the internet itself), and get comfortable building and deploying your own apps.

🧠 **Personal note:**  
I’ve mentored many engineers, and the first question I always ask is:  
**“What differentiates a junior from a senior?”**  
The most common answer? *“Technical skills.”*

And every time, I explain—*again*—that **tech skills alone are not the differentiator**.  
In fact, I’ve seen junior engineers with stronger technical chops than anyone else on the team—and still, they’re juniors.

Here’s what truly separates juniors from seniors:
- Soft skills and communication  
- Seeing the big picture  
- Giving credit where it’s due (you shine because someone else wrote that “bad” code you refactored into gold—so appreciate them!)  
- Understanding that tech debt isn’t evil—it’s a strategic tool when handled with care  
- Delegation, collaboration, influence, humility  

If you develop these, you’ll grow faster than any tutorial ever could.

The tricky part? You’ll never “feel” ready. Imposter syndrome is real — and universal. But confidence doesn’t come from titles; it comes from capability.

So if you’ve:
- Built a few projects on GitHub,  
- Can explain how the web works (to your mom or your cat),  
- Know basic HTML/CSS/JS (and maybe a little React),  
- And can deploy a site without Googling “how to push to GitHub”…  

👀 Then guess what? You’re *not* a junior dev anymore. You’re just… a **developer**. Own it.

The worst thing that happens when you apply to intermediate roles? You get told no.  
The best thing? You level up.

👉 **Stop aiming low. Don't work on a dusty WordPress plugin at a law firm. Build skills. Play the long game.**
