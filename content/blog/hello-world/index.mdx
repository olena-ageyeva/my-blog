This is my first post on my new blog! How exciting!

I am currently on vacation enjoying plenty of free time to rethink my day-to-day life concepts and approaches and put my reflection into words.

What I discovered that at my age and stage with all work and life experience and expertise combined I am still very shy when it comes to myself. I wish I had that much freedom as the person in the quote below.

But on the second thought do I really? Once doing some sort of job search preps I was tasked to outline my mission to put it in LinkedIn profile summary. I propably have chosen not the best one in ultimate sense, but the one that I came up with describes me pretty accurately.

In my time at Commonwealth Financial Network I signed up for a "Build Your Brand" training. During a first session people in the room were asked to think of one word that desribes what they would like others to see them like. Most of people said "professional" which probably makes a tons of sense, but for some reason does not resonate with me much. I do not want others to see me as a professional - that's the internal ethic out of question. But what I really want to look like is "approachable". The one people come with all sorts of problems and questions and get them all taken care of at all cost. That's why I like so much the recommendation my former collegue Carla left on my LinkedIn profile. It indicates that my ultimate goal to be "approachable" as a brand is being seen by others.

To summarize all said being here for others is one of or maybe even the only my growth need that do not stem from a lack of something, but rather from a desire to grow as a person. Accourding to the theory once such growth needs have been reasonably satisfied, one may be able to reach the highest level called self-actualization. From my own experience I can say that being "just a phone call away" for my teammates and friends is something that drives me in life, increases my motivation to expand in-depth expertise in different scopes and areas, and simply makes me happy.

Some of the recent community projects I started or participated in:

Together with a collaborative team of STEAM field professionals (actuaries, university faculties, teachers, technology managers) we developed a light scalable alternative model to teach children STEM and math within a real world context and nurture a true love and even addition (in a sense of intence irresistable desire) to learning.
4. GWP - Growing Well Preschool - A bilingual in-depth program based on constructivist theme-inspired model of education ran in collaboration with multiple local studios including Draw to Grow, Znaika, Sally's Dance, Yoga with Danny, and more.
