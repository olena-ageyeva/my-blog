Another good quote from my favorite book.

> The three soldiers returning home from war were hungry. When they saw the village ahead
> their spirits lifted they were sure the villagers would give them a meal. But when they got
> there, they found the doors locked and the windows closed. After many years of war, the
> villagers were short of food, and hoarded what they had.
>
> Undeterred, the soldiers boiled a pot of water and carefully placed three stones into it.
> The amazed villagers came out to watch.
>
> "This is stone soup," the soldiers explained. "Is that all you put in it?" asked the
> villagers. "Absolutely although some say it tastes even better with a few carrots." A
> villager ran off, returning in no time with a basket of carrots from his hoard.
>
> A couple of minutes later, the villagers again asked "Is that it?"
>
> "Well," said the soldiers, "a couple of potatoes give it body." Off ran another villager.
>
> Over the next hour , the soldiers listed more ingredients that would enhance the soup: beef,
> leeks, salt, and herbs. Each time a different villager would run off to raid their personal
> stores.
>
> Eventually they had produced a large pot of steaming soup. The soldiers removed the stones,
> and they sat down with the entire village to enjoy the first square meal any of them had eaten
> in months.
>
> There are a couple of morals in the stone soup story. The villagers are tricked by the
> soldiers, who use the villagers' curiosity to get food from them. But more importantly, the
> soldiers act as a catalyst, bringing the village together so they can jointly produce
> something that they couldn't have done by themselves a synergistic result. Eventually everyone
> wins.
>
> Every now and then, you might want to emulate the soldiers.
>
> You may be in a situation where you know exactly what needs doing and how to do it. The
> entire system just appears before your eyes you know it's right. But ask permission to tackle
> the whole thing and you'll be met with delays and blank stares. People will form committees ,
> budgets will need approval, and things will get complicated. Everyone will guard their own
> resources. Sometimes this is called "start-up fatigue."
>
> It's time to bring out the stones. Work out what you can reasonably ask for. Develop it well.
> Once you've got it, show people, and let them marvel. Then say "of course, it would be better
> if we added." Pretend it's not important. Sit back and wait for them to start asking you to add
> the functionality you originally wanted. People find it easier to join an ongoing success.
> Show them a glimpse of the future and you'll get them to rally around.
>
> The Villagers' Side
> On the other hand, the stone soup story is also about gentle and gradual deception. It's about
> focusing too tightly. The villagers think about the stones and forget about the rest of the
> world. We all fall for it, every day. Things just creep up on us.
>
> We've all seen the symptoms. Projects slowly and inexorably get totally out of hand. Most
> software disasters start out too small to notice, and most project overruns happen a day at
> a time. Systems drift from their specifications feature by feature, while patch after patch
> gets added to a piece of code until there's nothing of the original left. It's often the
> accumulation of small things that breaks morale and teams .
>
> We've never tried this honest. But they say that if you take a frog and drop it into boiling
> water, it will jump straight back out again. However, if you place the frog in a pan of cold
> water, then gradually heat it, the frog won't notice the slow increase in temperature and
> will stay put until cooked .
>
> Note that the frog's problem is different from the broken windows issue discussed in Section 2.
> In the Broken Window Theory, people lose the will to fight entropy because they perceive
> that no one else cares. The frog just doesn't notice the change.
>
> Don't be like the frog. Keep an eye on the big picture. Constantly review what's happening
> around you, not just what you personally are doing.

> While reviewing a draft of this book, John Lakos raised the following issue: The soldiers
