I love data—it’s my thing. I track numbers for almost everything, even my own custom daily score (yes, I compete with yesterday-me). Naturally, this habit doesn’t take a break during conferences.

AWS re:Invent is one of the world’s biggest tech events, and I always enjoy attending. The last-day **re:Play** party has become iconic, featuring world-class celebrity DJs, music groups, engaging games, an inclusive menu, and more.

While soaking in the festivities, I couldn’t help but make an observation. Turning to a colleague, I quipped:  
**“Want to guess how many women attended re:Invent? 5%.”**

They laughed and asked:  
**“How did you figure that out?”**

I gestured toward the most compelling evidence: two massive, snaking lines—each easily a hundred men deep—stretching toward the gentlemen’s restroom.

And the ladies’? A peaceful void. Not a line, not a wait. Just blissful emptiness. Out of curiosity, I walked in and counted about **10 women** inside.

So: 10 inside, 200 in line. That’s how I ballparked it—**5%**.

It felt like the restroom lines were delivering a live, unfiltered demographic report. 😏

Now, while I’m 95% confident in my restroom-line methodology (pun intended), I do wonder:

1️⃣ What’s the *actual* data? Is the attendee demographic breakdown published?  
2️⃣ Did others notice the same imbalance and draw similar conclusions?  
3️⃣ What are the flaws in my logic? (Because even data-driven humor deserves statistical scrutiny.)

Let me know what you think!  
And to my fellow data nerds: at your next conference, take a glance at the restroom lines—  
they might just be the most unexpected dataset of the day. 😉
