Twenty years ago, Masha and I were studying economics at the kitchen table. Not through textbooksâ€”those came laterâ€”but through a hands-on curriculum of pocket money and chore charts. Each completed task earned a meticulously negotiated $1, to be spent strictly on lifeâ€™s essentials: ice cream, comics, and the occasional glittery sticker.

It was a simple system. Transparent incentives. Immediate feedback. Perfectly designed for a curious seven-year-old and a mom determined to make sure economics felt both real and rewarding.

Fast forward two decades, and that same seven-year-old is now a rising economistâ€”offered an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and admitted to Dukeâ€™s Ph.D. program in economics. The incentives have changed. The stakes are higher. But the instincts are the same.

Back then, I was teaching her how money moves. Now sheâ€™s preparing to shape how economies move.

They say early education leaves a mark. I like to think ours came with a budget, a purpose, and a little extra whipped cream.
