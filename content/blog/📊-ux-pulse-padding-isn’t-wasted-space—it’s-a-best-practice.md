**MYTH:** Padding is unnecessary white space.\
**FACT:** Padding improves usability.

- - -

Some may think:

❌ *"More padding = wasted space"*

❌ *"Users don’t notice padding"*

❌ *"It’s just a visual thing"*

- - -

All wrong. Users **feel** bad padding before they even notice it.

> Ever scrolled through a site that felt overwhelming?
>
> Tapped a tiny button and missed?
>
> Struggled to read text packed too tightly?

That’s **bad padding**.

- - -

But **good padding**:

✅ Improves readability

✅ Guides the user’s eye

✅ Creates a sense of order

- - -

It’s not decoration — it’s **structure**.

When a design feels right, users trust it.

**Good padding = Good UX.**
