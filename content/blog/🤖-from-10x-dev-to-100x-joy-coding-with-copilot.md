description: A practical demo on setting up Storybook with MUI, creating UI
  components with variants, and applying the restrictiveâ€“flexible patternâ€”all
  while navigating the wild ride of Copilot suggestions. Expertise meets AI in
  this fast-paced, slightly opinionated (and very real) build session.

About a year ago, I set out to create a demo for my team.
The goal?
Teach front-end best practices, show off what **Storybook** can do, and introduce a pattern I loveâ€”**restrictiveâ€“flexible components**. You know, the kind that lock in good defaults but still let you override them when needed. Clean. Scalable. Practical.

So I hit record. Built a component from scratch. MUI under the hood. Variants and all.

And then... **Copilot showed up.**

Suddenly, what was supposed to be a focused walkthrough turned into a surprise battle of wills between **my engineering instincts** and **AI-generated optimism**.

Copilot offered suggestions at every turnâ€”some helpful, some hilariously off, some oddly insightful.

I overrode more than half. But hereâ€™s the thing:
I still worked faster. I still had more fun.

What started as a demo for my team turned into a real-time case study in **working with AI, not against it**.

ðŸš€ **And the truth is, this shift isnâ€™t going away.**

According to Stack Overflowâ€™s 2023 Developer Survey,

> ðŸ§  70% of developers are already using or planning to use AI tools in their workflows.

GitHub reports that **developers using Copilot code up to 55% faster** and spend less time on boilerplate or repetitive tasks.

This isnâ€™t just an emerging trendâ€”itâ€™s already a transformation.

AI isnâ€™t coming for the keyboard. **Itâ€™s sitting next to us nowâ€”like a very chatty pair programmer.**

And it's not going back in the box.

If youâ€™re curious how it looked in action, ðŸŽ¬ watch the demo and see how it all came together. Enjoy!
