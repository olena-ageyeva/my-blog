About a year ago, I set out to create a demo for my teams.
The goal?
Teach front-end best practices, show off what **Storybook** can do, and introduce a pattern I love—**restrictive–flexible components**. You know, the kind that lock in good defaults but still let you override them when needed. Clean. Scalable. Practical.

So I hit record. Built a component from scratch. MUI under the hood. Variants and all.

And then... **Copilot showed up.**

Suddenly, what was supposed to be a focused walkthrough turned into a surprise battle of wills between **my engineering instincts** and **AI-generated optimism**.

Copilot offered suggestions at every turn—some helpful, some hilariously off, some oddly insightful.

I overrode more than half. But here’s the thing:
I still worked faster. I still had more fun.

What started as a demo for my teams turned into a real-time case study in **working with AI, not against it**.

🚀 **And the truth is, this shift isn’t going away.**

According to Stack Overflow’s 2023 Developer Survey,

> 🧠 70% of developers are already using or planning to use AI tools in their workflows.
> ([source](<>))
>
> GitHub reports that **developers using Copilot code up to 55% faster** and spend less time on boilerplate or repetitive tasks. 
> ([source](<>))

This isn’t just an emerging trend—it’s already a transformation.

AI isn’t coming for the keyboard. **It’s sitting next to us now—like a very chatty pair programmer.**

And it's not going back in the box.

If you’re curious how it looked in action, 🎬 watch the demo and see how it all came together. Enjoy!

⚠️ Enjoy it while it lasts—while experts like myself are still here to outperform AI in real time. Believe me, we’re a vanishing breed.
