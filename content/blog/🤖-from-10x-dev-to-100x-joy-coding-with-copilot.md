description: A practical demo on setting up Storybook with MUI, creating UI
  components with variants, and applying the restrictive‚Äìflexible pattern‚Äîall
  while navigating the wild ride of Copilot suggestions. Expertise meets AI in
  this fast-paced, slightly opinionated (and very real) build session.

I recently created a demo to help my team level up on **UI best practices** and **component library design** using **Storybook + MUI**.

In this walkthrough, I show how to:
- Set up Storybook from scratch
- Build a UI component with well-defined **variants**
- Apply the **restrictive‚Äìflexible pattern** ‚Äî where defaults are protected, but one-off customizations are still possible

The goal: create a consistent, maintainable component system that balances **control** with **flexibility**.

But here‚Äôs what made this demo extra interesting...

While recording, I had **GitHub Copilot** on ‚Äî and it turned into the perfect live illustration of my daily ‚Äúcollaboration‚Äù with AI.

 Copilot chimed in with a *lot* of suggestions.  
 I accepted maybe half.  
 Still, I worked faster.  
 And, to be honest, the experience was more joyful.

Even when I disagree with it, Copilot is like an overconfident intern who *occasionally nails it*.  
It doesn‚Äôt replace expertise ‚Äî it accelerates it.

üé¨ **Watch the demo** and see how it all came together. Enjoy!
